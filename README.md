# mingw-w64-binary-builds
Mingw-w64 binary builds to help users bootstrap a mingw-w64 toolchain for their system! Ideal for Linux From Scratch and building Wine!
# What to do
Go to the releases section and download either the packaged tarball or the resulting tarball that is given from github automatically, then unpack it wherever (/opt is recommended)! Change the `PATH` variable to be `$MINGWDIR/usr/bin:$PATH` where `$MINGWDIR` would be replaced with where you unpacked the mingw-w64 tarball, including the resulting directory itself. Then you're ready to do what you must to compile binutils, mingw-w64-{headers,crt,winpthreads}, and finally gcc for the <architecture>-w64-mingw32 target to bootstrap the mingw-w64 toolchain! The resulting files can be put in /usr and you will no longer need to depend on your binary mingw-w64 installtion provided here to run the toolchain and compile projects like Wine or software targeting Windows. For instructions on how to compile that software, as of now, I (Zeckma) have not made a YouTube video going over how to do so, so for now, please refer to the PKGBUILDS on Arch Linux's package website by going to 'source files' and going to the PKGBUILD. Be careful as any wrong move can destroy your system and ability to compile software. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
